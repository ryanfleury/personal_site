Hi! My name is Ryan. I grew up in Colorado in the United States. I found my love for interactive experiences when I started playing Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda when I was about four years old. I've since developed a passion for making those experiences.

I've been working with software and developing games since I was about five or six years old, when my older brother introduced me to QBasic and RPG Maker. Over time, I found myself fighting against pre-built engines and higher-level languages in order to get very specific results, so I became more interested in lower-level programming and custom game engine development over time. Nowadays, I spend most of my free time writing custom games, and game engines, with (almost) no dependencies in C. You can learn more about what I'm working on @link {"here", "projects.html"}.

I am currently working as an engine programmer at @link {"Epic Games Tools", "http://www.radgametools.com/"}. I studied computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder.

In mid-2018, I became the team lead at Handmade Network to help promote a better programming culture that is focused on the user, understanding hardware, and re-evaluating important decisions in computing.

This website is a collection of my @link {"projects", "projects.html"} and @link {"blog posts", "blog.html"} filled with software engineering and game development thoughts and experiences. Thanks for visiting!
